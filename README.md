## 1. Introduction

The Soccer Prediction System is a web-based application that predicts soccer match outcomes based on historical data and machine learning algorithms. This documentation provides an overview of the project, instructions for installation, and details on how to use and contribute to the system.

## 2. Project Overview

The system uses Flask as the web framework and integrates machine learning models for predicting match results. It also leverages Docker for containerization, making deployment and distribution easier.

## 3. Getting Started

### 3.1 Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python (3.8 or higher)
- Docker (if using Docker)

### 3.2 Installation

Clone the project repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mstrmindz/soccer-prediction-system.git
cd soccer-prediction-system
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 4. Running the Application

### 4.1 Using Docker

Build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t soccer-predictor .
```

Run the Docker container:

```bash
docker run -p 5000:5000 soccer-predictor
```

### 4.2 Using Flask

Run the Flask application:

```bash
flask run
```

The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:5000` in your web browser.
